What is UnitTest?

Here we test units of our code
    Classes, methods, functions etc
    If that Class/method/function have dependencies being injected, we moq them ( Repositories, File sytem, services etc )
        WE MOCK BECAUSE WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT DEPENDENCY
        WE DONT CARE IF THE DEPENDENCY IS WORKING, WE ASSUME IT IS AND MOCK THE RESULTS IT SHOULD BE GIVING US
    We want to test if our units does ITS JOB correctly once the dependency gives us what we expect from it.

    This is the UnitTests project where we mock repositories manually, we wrote some mocks and we 
    injet them via dependency injection 

    On the other project UnitTestsMoq we use Moq framework to mock the repositories, so that we 
    don't need to write moqs, fakes or stubs ourselves.
